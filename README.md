Welcome to my repository! This space is a collection of presentation slides I’ve created to communicate ideas, concepts, and technical insights effectively.

About Me

I am Harish, a Mechanical Engineering student with a strong foundation in:

CAD Design (AutoCAD, SolidWorks)

3D Modeling and product visualization

Kinematics & Core Mechanical concepts

But my learning doesn’t stop at mechanical engineering. I believe in integrated knowledge, which pushes me to expand my skills into:

Full-Stack Web Development (MERN Stack) 

Python Programming for problem-solving and automation

Why this repo?

Communication is as important as technical work. These slides reflect my efforts in presenting engineering concepts, software knowledge, and interdisciplinary ideas in a clear and structured manner.

Current Focus

Bridging Mechanical Engineering with Software Development

Learning how digital tools can transform traditional engineering

Building a polymath mindset by combining core engineering with coding and design thinking
